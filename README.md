this is a simulation of interactions, reproduction and death in a population

in rockpaperscissors.py, the area is populated with cells that only play rock. Every 5 seconds, the top five cells in terms of 
fitness reproduce, and 5 randomly die. Each cell that is born has a chance to mutate to the move that beats its parent - 
rock -> paper -> scissors.

The populations are plotted on the bottom section of the screen.

------------------------------------

in hawkdove.py, the area is populated with hawks and doves. They interact with eachother and gain levels of fitness depending on who they
meet. Each second the top 6 birds in terms of fitness reproduce, and 6 randoms die. Each bird that is born has a 5% chance to be the opposite
of its parent.

Hawks are red, doves are green.

The populations are plotted.

-------------------------------------

to watch these simulations, just run their respective python file.

in both, you can pause and unpause the simulation with space, and quit the simulation with q. to see the characteristics of the cell,
click on it, and the characteristics are printed in the output.

To access and change parameters, press s.
